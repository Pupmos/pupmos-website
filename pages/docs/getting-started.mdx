# Ethos

As develpuppers, we are dedicated to upholding the values of friendship, sovereignty, interoperability, and decentralization in everything we do. These core tenants guide our every action and decision, and we strive to facilitate them on behalf of our beloved corgi leader and the community of friends that we serve.

As a contributor, representative, and technologist in the Cosmos ecosystem, Pupmos is committed to making a positive impact and standing up for what he believes in. This is evident in our defiant votes on pivotal proposals, preventing powerful central governments from imposing their will upon stakeholders. It's also evident in our Govmos liquid staking system, which empowers the voices of users rather than silencing them.

At Pupmos, we believe in the power of community and strive to participate in DAOs every day. We are also proud to open source tools like Kennel, which are designed to make the lives of Cosmos developers easier and more efficient. We understand the pains and challenges that community members may be facing and are here to help alleviate them through our contributions and efforts.

If you share our values and are looking for a principled, dedicated partner in the Cosmos ecosystem, look no further than Pupmos. We are here to stand by your side and work together to build a better future for all.
