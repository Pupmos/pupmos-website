# Govmos

Developed by Pupmos, Govmos is a revolutionary system that allows decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to incorporate the essential features of liquid staking, including _**voting, delegating, and autocompounding**_, while preserving the social mechanisms that are important to users. With Govmos, you could build a dex with voting rights, or self-paying loans, or a stablecoin that picks validators, all within the same system.

One of the main challenges of liquid staking is _**maintaining social consensus**_. Govmos has been designed to address this issue by providing a secure and composable architecture that can be implemented across any protocol, including IBC. This allows users to retain their sovereignty and autonomy over their voting and delegating, while still taking advantage of the benefits of liquid staking.


In addition to preserving social consensus, Govmos also makes it easy to maximize yield beyond vanilla autocompounding offered by services like restake. This feature allows you to automatically reinvest your returns into the DeFi protocol of your choice, ensuring that you are always getting the most out of your investments.


Overall, Govmos is a powerful tool for DeFi protocols looking to incorporate liquid staking in a safe and user-friendly way. With its focus on social consensus and user autonomy, Govmos is poised to become the go-to solution for DeFi protocols looking to implement liquid staking.
